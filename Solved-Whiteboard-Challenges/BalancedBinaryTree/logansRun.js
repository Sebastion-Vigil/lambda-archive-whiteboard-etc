// so I'm going off on a quick little tangent to write a 
// function that finds the logarithm of a given number
// why have I decided to take a brief little detour down 
// this little rabbit hole?
// ultimately I seek a better understanding of O(log(n))
// knowing how and when to use it is of great interest to me...

// so what exactly is a logarithm? 
// first off, at the end of the day it's just an exponent
// every positive number greater than 1 has a logarithm

// the logarithm of a given number is the exponent to which 
// another fixed number, the base, must be raised to produce that number
